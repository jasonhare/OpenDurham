<p><span style='font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent'>In discussion with ODS I have asked them to add a service called “Random Perturbation” that will obfuscate the crime locations and other location data that might be sensitive.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is an explanation of Geomasking done by ESRI- the advantage of having this out of the box is that it gives jurisdictions a defensible position when releasing sensitive data. No other platform does this. Chicago changes the last two digits of the street address to “xx” but this is nortiously unreliable. </span></p>
<p><span>Geomasking techniques are discussed in this ESRI document:</span></p>

<p><span>The method I would like - which is similar to what we did in Raleigh- is Random Perturbation:</span></p>
<p><span>A number of different geographic masking techniques have been developed over the years. All of these include some degree of randomization in order to reduce the risk of reidentification. </span></p>
<p><span>(1)  Random Direction and Fixed Radius. Masked points are placed on a random location on a circle around the original location. Masked points are not placed inside the circle itself.</span></p>
<p><span>(2)  Random Perturbation within a Circle. Masked locations are placed anywhere within a circular area around the original location. Since every location within the circle is equally likely, masked locations are more likely to be placed at larger distances compared to small distances. A variation on this technique is the use of random direction and random radius. In this technique, masked points are displaced using a vector with random direction and random radius. The radius is constrained by a maximum value. This effectively results in a circular area where masked locations can be placed, but the masked locations are as likely to be at large distances compared to small distances. These two techniques therefore only differ slightly in the probability of how close masked locations are placed to the original locations.</span></p>
<p><span>(3)  Gaussian Displacement. The direction of displacement is random, but the distance follows a Gaussian distribution. The dispersion of the distribution can be varied based on other parameters of interest, such as local population density.</span></p>
<p><span>(4)  Donut Masking. This technique is similar to random displacement within a circle, but a smaller internal circle is utilized within which displacement is not allowed. In effect, this sets a minimum and maximum level for the displacement. Masked locations are placed anywhere within the allowable area. A slightly different approach to donut masking is the use of a random direction and two random radii: one for maximum and one for minimum displacement. These two techniques only differ slightly in the probability of how close masked locations are placed to the original locations. Both approaches enforce a minimum amount of displacement.</span></p>
<p><span>(5)  Bimodal Gaussian Displacement. This is a variation on the Gaussian masking technique, employing a bimodal Gaussian distribution for the random distance function. In effect, this approximates donut masking, but with a less uniform probability of placement.</span></p>
<p><span>While these methods are presented here as separate methods, several are slightly revised versions of each other. For example, donut masking and bimodal Gaussian displacement are very similar in terms of the general area where masked locations are placed relative to the original locations.</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br /><small>Updated on <abbr class="updated" title="2015-04-19T18:33:17.630Z">Apr 19, 2015</abbr> by <span class="author"><span class="vcard"><a class="fn" href="mailto:kateysdad@gmail.com">Jason Hare</a></span></span> (<a href="history.html">Version <span class="sites:revision">1</span></a>)</small><br /><br /></div></div></td></tr></table></body></html>
