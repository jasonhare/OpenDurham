<p><span>The 60-day phase focuses on data selection, cleansing, validation, and process development as well as publishing data to a test platform. This phase is also where we will introduce the modules that make up the program methodology from a technical and workflow perspective. The development of the program management methodology are based on the same standards that I helped develop for the Open Government Partnership Open Data Working Group: Data collection, curating, management and publication; Use of well-documented, standard work flow for data management; Data analytics; Privacy safeguarding and redaction of personally Identifiable information (PII).</span></p>
