Upcoming activities: The next 30 days</h2><div> </div><div>The priority will be to have county sites and dashboards ready for Greg’s presentation to the County Commissioners in early April. A major accomplishment this week was establishing open data as part of the internal data innovation team that meets at American Underground on Thursdays at 8:30AM. This gives us access to a majority of the county data sets. The 60-day phase focuses on data selection, cleansing, validation, and process development as well as publishing data to a test platform. This phase is also where we will introduce the modules that make up the program methodology from a technical and workflow perspective. The development of the program management methodology are based on the same standards that I helped develop for the Open Government Partnership Open Data Working Group: Data collection, curating, management and publication; Use of well-documented, standard work flow for data management; Data analytics; Privacy safeguarding and redaction of personally Identifiable information (PII).</div><div><br/></div><div><ul><li><span style='line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent'>Review first 30 days performance.  </span></li><li><span style='line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent'>Ensure all plans for the first 30 days are completed. </span></li><li><span style='line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent'>Continue the level of communication with CIOs, and co-workers to establish teamwork</span></li><li><span style='line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent'>Data Set Evaluation and Inventory: Open data programs build on established digital data sources and information management procedures within government where they already exist.

Key Risks and Issues:</h2><div> </div><div>So far we have not encountered anything that can be qualified as a stop risk. There is some risk in getting data sets from County data stakeholders during the budget season. Given, though, that we have access to a large number of data sets right now, we would only need the stakeholder to sign off the planned usage of the data.</div><div> </div><div><b>The largest risks are listed below:</b></div><div> </div><div><ul><li><span style='line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent'>Currently there is a policy that GIS data cannot be used without paying a fee. This policy needs to be changed. We cannot not have a limit on the CCSA or CC0 license that will need to be in place on the portal in order to comply with international open data standards. </span></li><li><span style='line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent'>Data that is served through proprietary format only, such as RAIDS, is a risk in that the public perception of openness will be undermined. There is also an active media concern about the release of public safety data only through RAIDS. This will seriously undermine the credibility of the program.</span></li><li><span style='line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent'>Not having communications resources stretches the capabilities of the team to meet our deadlines. </span></li><li><span style='line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent'>I  need access to major department heads in order to communicate the benefit and value of releasing open data. Having to go through intermediaries creates risk in that there is an inherent dependency on the amount of time intermediaries and other members of the open data team can commit. I do understand that the City and the County are under-resourced. That being said I can move very fast if allowed to do so. I have experience on the politics of local government.</span></li></ul></div><div> </div><h2><a name='TOC-E.-What-decisions-or-Guidance-is-needed-from-the-CIOs-'/>E. What decisions or Guidance is needed from the CIOs?</h2><div> </div><div>Guidance on engagement with data stakeholders right now is the only thing I need. Kerry is going to introduce me to Chief Lopez but I do not have a timeline. Greg has been talking with department heads. If we can find out who then I can make contact and start mining the data.</div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br /><small>Updated on <abbr class="updated" title="2015-03-05T02:52:56.009Z">Mar 5, 2015</abbr> by <span class="author"><span class="vcard"><a class="fn" href="mailto:kateysdad@gmail.com">Jason Hare</a></span></span> (<a href="history.html">Version <span class="sites:revision">2</span></a>)</small><br /><br /></div></div></td></tr></table></body></html>
