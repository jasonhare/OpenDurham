<p><span><b>Meeting/Policies:</b></span></p>
<p><span>Yesterday’s meeting went very well. We went over each deck that the CIOs will be using on Monday. Ivan should sending both corrected decks for all of us to use when we discuss this initiative, I will be there for the County 9:30 meeting and then hopefully, I can synch up with the City later in the afternoon to see how Kerry’s presentation went. Both CIOs in different meetings agreed on the use of opendurham,gov as the domain. Now we need to see who will be registering that domain.</span></p>
<p><span>The business process of approving data for the portal will be a little different between the City and the County for now. All data stewards must give a sign off via email. For the City, for now at least, we need the City Manager’s approval before data can be released. I don’t see that as a problem since our data releases will be in large batches rather than piecemeal. We will soon have a calendar of data sets and when they will be released so the chain of command can have final sign off.</span></p>
<p><span>We have a draft of the TOS/SLA at the bottom of the opendurham page. The link is called legals. I have the license draft finished and I will shortly have the data restriction policy completed along with the business process policy. All policies will be the same for the City and the County. This is per the conversation Kerry and I had this morning.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Maturity Model (Attachment):</b></span></p>
<p><span>So part of what I do is work with the Open Data Institute on projects. As an ODI member I get access to the work product once it has been assigned a version number.</span></p>
<p><span>Attached is an Excel Workbook that has a maturity model along with benefits and outcomes. There are five themes that roughly correlate to the four tracks we are currently using to measure success:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Data management processes — identifies the key business processes that underpin data management and publication including quality control, publication workflows, and adoption of technical standards.<span>	</span><span>	</span><span>	</span></span></li>
<li><span>Knowledge &amp; skills — highlights the steps required to create a culture of open data within an organization by identifying the knowledge sharing, training and learning required to embed an understanding of the benefits of open data.<span>	</span><span>	</span><span>	</span><span>	</span><span>	</span><span>	</span></span></li>
<li><span>Customer support &amp; engagement — addresses the need for an organization to engage with both their data sources and their data re-users to provide sufficient support and feedback to make open data successful.<span>	</span></span></li>
<li><span>Investment &amp; financial performance — covers the need for organizations to have insight into the value of their datasets and the appropriate budgetary and financial oversight required to support their publication. In terms of data consumption, organizations will need to understand the costs and value associated with their re-use of third-party datasets.<span>	</span><span>	</span><span>	</span><span>	</span><span>	</span><span>	</span></span></li>
<li><span>Strategic oversight — highlights the need for an organization to have a clear strategy around data sharing and re-use, and an identified leadership with responsibility and capacity to deliver that strategy.<span>	</span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>As you can see, everything we have been doing to date matches the outcomes and the measurements to be used in calculating value. So now it is not just me that is advocating this model but the inventor of the Web himself, Tim Berners Lee. So if the maturity model question comes up- feel free to use this. I can answer any questions on the specifics.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s discuss this at our next meeting along with the policies that I will be sending this weekend.</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br /><small>Updated on <abbr class="updated" title="2015-04-03T20:08:43.127Z">Apr 3, 2015</abbr> by <span class="author"><span class="vcard"><a class="fn" href="mailto:kateysdad@gmail.com">Jason Hare</a></span></span> (<a href="history.html">Version <span class="sites:revision">1</span></a>)</small><br /><br /></div><hr /><div><b>Attachments (1)</b><br /><br /><div class="hentry attachment" id="https://sites.google.com/feeds/content/site/opendatadurham/4153673849526018789"><a class="entry-content entry-title" href="Open Data Maturity Model (Edition 1.0 _ 31 March 2015).xlsx">Open Data Maturity Model (Edition 1.0 _ 31 March 2015).xlsx</a> - on <abbr class="updated" title="2015-04-03T20:08:43.449Z">Apr 3, 2015</abbr> by <span class="author"><span class="vcard"><a class="fn" href="mailto:kateysdad@gmail.com">Jason Hare</a></span></span> (Version <span class="sites:revision">1</span>)</div></div></div></td></tr></table></body></html>
