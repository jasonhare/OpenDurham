Ivan suggested some nomenclature edits to the draft. Jason will make those edits and then share the 30-60-90 with everyone on this email. Jason asked Ivan and Anthony access to any relevant artifacts from the Durham Open Data Proof of Concept. Both Anthony and Ivan said they would give Jason access.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Discussion of work space and times on site</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Currently, Jason will work at City offices until Ivan is able to secure some facilities at the County. Jason suggested 2 days at the City and two days at the County. Any meetings with County data stewards would take place in County facilities. Any meetings with City data stewards would take place at City facilities. Jason and the program are both results driven. Jason as a general practice keeps a log of his activities so they can be presented with his weekly time sheet. Both of these documents are generated weekly and are archived chronologically.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Discussion of work plan based on 30-60-90 plan</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Ivan and Anthony will share with Jason the agreed upon timeline so the 30-60-90 day plan an be mapped to that timeline. Jason will work with Ivan and Anthony symmetrically by communicating any emails generated by this project to both of the project managers. Jason reports to both CIOs and will similarly communicate symmetrically with both CIOs. </div><div><br/></div><div><b>Delivery of first invoice for hours one up to date</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Jason has his first weekly time sheet. This is for the week of the 15th to the 17th of January. Jason’s time sheets run Monday through Sunday. Work can sometimes fall in non-standard hours and days for local civic events. </div><div><br/></div><div><b>Discussion of open data platform and vehicle of purchase</b></div><div><br/></div><div>The meeting this Tuesday will include a demo of the website with generic municipal data. Open Data Soft has spun up a Durham Data Portal. Jason Hare created a template from HTML5 and CSS3. We have not worked out a purchasing vehicle yet. To preserve the discounts, Jason suggested it purchased directly from the company rather than through another reseller. Anthony and Ivan informed Jason that the other vendors (Socrata and ESRI) had already given demonstrations of their respective platforms.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>Crafting of press release/Communications</b></div><div><br/></div><div>The final version of the press release was just circulated a few minutes ago. We discussed brining Kim Paterson on-board rather than having an agency do our work. Kim has the open data experience as well as the marketing and writing experience necessary to work with the open data team on managing social media, press releases and feature articles.</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>Action Items:</b></div><div><br/></div><div><ul><li><span style='line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent'>Jason will finish the template design and ship it to OpenDataSoft. OpenDataSoft will give a demonstration at this coming Tuesday’s meeting. Any datasets that the City or County would like to make available we can load on the portal for demonstration purposes. The content of the data for the demo will be local and national level data for the purposes of showing the features of the product.</span></li><li><span style='line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent'>Jason will schedule the time with ODS and the Durham open data team and create the future meeting events. </span></li><li><span style='line-height:1.25;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent'>Jason will schedule a time for Kim to meet with Les and Beverly.
